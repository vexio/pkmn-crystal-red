# Pokemon Crystal Red
Pokemon Crystal Red, a ROM Hack of Pokemon Fire Red aimed to re-create Johto and Kanto along with other post-game sidequests

## About
Pokemon Crystal Red is a recreation of the two neighboring regions, Kanto and Johto, with Fire Red based graphics. Along that, many of the routes are remastered and repopulated with different Pokemon. Postgame content (Such as Kanto and the Sevii Islands) will be revised as well.

## Roadmap
Currently, I will only be focusing on Johto, then move my attention to other Postgame content.
